# Project Overview

This is a web application designed for families and communities to preserve their history, connect with members, and archive memories. It provides a centralized platform for documenting history, sharing memories, and visualizing family trees. The application is built with a modern tech stack, including Next.js for the frontend and backend, Supabase for the database and authentication, and Google Gemini for AI-powered features.

## Key Features

*   **Visual Family Trees:** Create and visualize family trees for any community, not just genetic relatives.
*   **AI Assistant:** A conversational AI assistant, "LoreBot," helps users navigate the platform and learn about its features.
*   **Interactive Timeline:** An interactive timeline with animations to visualize historical events.
*   **Cloud Storage & Media Library:** Securely store and manage photos, videos, and other media.
*   **Community Feed:** A social feed to see updates and activities from the community.
*   **Image Analysis:** AI-powered image analysis to describe photos and suggest stories.

# Building and Running

This is a Vite-based project. The following scripts are available in `package.json`:

*   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
*   **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
*   **`npm run preview`**: Serves the production build locally for preview.

## Prerequisites

*   Node.js and npm installed.
*   A `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following environment variable:

# Development Conventions

*   **Tech Stack:** The project uses React, Vite, and TypeScript.
*   **Styling:** TailwindCSS is used for styling.
*   **Code Style:** The code follows standard React best practices, with functional components and hooks.
*   **Components:** The application is structured into reusable components located in the `src/components` directory.
