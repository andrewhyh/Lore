🌿 Lore Web UI Design Specification
🎨 Design Philosophy

“Nostalgia meets modernity.”
Lore’s design should feel personal and timeless — like flipping through an old photo album in a sleek digital space. Think Ancestry.com’s structured layout + Wikipedia’s organized content presentation + Notion’s modern simplicity + Instagram’s emotional visuality.

🧭 Core UX Goals

Ease of Discovery:
Users should easily find stories, people, and events through visual navigation (tree view, timelines, or community pages).

Storytelling First:
Every UI element should highlight narrative — photos, videos, and written memories.

Personal & Social Balance:
The design should support both private reflection and public sharing within communities.

Seamless Transitions:
Moving from a person’s story → their family → their timeline → their community should feel natural and visually consistent.
