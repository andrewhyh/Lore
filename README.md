Product Overview:

Problem Statement:

   Families and communities lack an easy, centralized platform to preserve their history, connect members, and archive memories across generations. Existing solutions either focus solely on genealogy or are too complex for everyday users.

Target Users:

   Primary: Families wanting to document their history and share memories
   Secondary: Communities (churches, sports teams, schools, friend groups)
   Tertiary: Individuals creating personal life archives

Key Differentiators

   Visual family trees for ANY community (not just genetic relatives)
   AI assistant that proactively suggests archiving actions
   Combined timeline + tree + storage in one platform
   Social feed showing community activity
   Accessible, intuitive design for all ages
